The aim of this project is to create a self driving car that will actively avoid crashing into obstacles. We will use the servo mounted ultrasonic sensor to look around, 
and gauge the distance between obstacles. From this, the car's logic will decide on where to go. It will aim torwards the path of least resistance, or in this case, the path that
has obstacles further away.
